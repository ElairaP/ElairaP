### Examples
-[Final Year Project](https://github.com/ElairaP/FYP)    
Final Year Project I completed as part of my degree. This project involves an analytic comparison of machine learning models in a breast cancer classification task. The project also involves using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to investigate relationships between model features and prediction. This results obtained from the XAI methods are used to explain why the model makes certain predictions.

-[Data Analysis Project in Excel](https://github.com/ElairaP/Retail-sales-excel-project/tree/main)  
In this project I used a dataset I found on kaggle to analyse and create visualisations in excel.

-[Data Analysis Project in Python](https://github.com/ElairaP/student-performance-data-project)  
In this project I used a dataset I found on kaggle and used python to analyse the data and create visualisations to determine if there were any correlations between student academic performance and certain factors such as parental support, tutoring etc.

-[University Assignment using Java and SQL](https://github.com/ElairaP/Library-system-assignment/tree/main)  
In this assigment I used Java and PostgreSQL to implement a library system. The program allows a user to input an author name and library location and the program will then display all the books available in that library location by that author.
